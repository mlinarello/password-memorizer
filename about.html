      <h2>About the Password Memorizer App</h2>
      <p>
        The Password Memorizer App helps you securely store and manage your
        passwords for various services without actually storing your passwords.
      </p>
      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        When you save a password for a service, the app converts your password
        into a hash using a strong cryptographic algorithm (SHA256). This hash
        is a unique representation of your password, but it cannot be reversed
        to find out the original password.
      </p>
      <p>Here's why it's safe:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> The hashed password is stored
          locally on your device, in your browser's local storage. This means
          your password data never leaves your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hashing for Security:</strong> Hashing is a process that
          transforms your password into a fixed-length string of characters.
          Even if someone accesses the hash, they cannot reverse it to get your
          original password.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Transmission of Data:</strong> The app does not send your
          password or its hash over the internet. All operations are performed
          locally on your device, ensuring maximum privacy and security.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you want to verify a password, the app hashes the password you
        enter and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, you know you've
        entered the correct password.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach ensures that your actual passwords are never stored and
        remain secure on your device.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for using the Password Memorizer App!</p>
