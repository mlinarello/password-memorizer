## Overview

The Password Memorizer App is a simple, secure tool to help you store and manage your passwords. Instead of saving your actual passwords, it stores hashed versions, ensuring that your sensitive information remains safe.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Your passwords are never stored directly. Instead, they are converted into secure hashes.
- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally on your device, ensuring that your passwords never leave your device.
- **Simple Interface**: Easily save and manage your passwords with an intuitive interface.

## How It Works

1. **Save a Password**: Enter the service name and your password. The app converts your password into a hash and stores it locally.
2. **Test a Password**: When you need to verify a password, enter it again. The app will hash the entered password and compare it to the stored hash.
3. **Clear All Data**: You can clear all stored data at any time using the "Clear All" button.

## Security

- **Hashing**: Passwords are converted into a fixed-length string using a strong cryptographic algorithm, which cannot be reversed to reveal the original password.
- **Local Storage**: All hashed passwords are stored in your browser's local storage, ensuring that they are never transmitted over the internet.
